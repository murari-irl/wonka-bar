        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            Step into the world where chocolate isn't just candy -- it's pure imagination
            brought to life by the enigmatic genius himself, Willy Wonka. Inside his mysterious
            factory, where steam-powered chocolate rivers flow and candy trees grow to the ceiling,
            Mr. Wonka has crafted his masterpiece: The Wonka Bar.
        </p>
        <p>
            This isn't just chocolate. It's a symphony of flavors conducted by
            a maestro of confectionery. Each bar is infused with the same whimsical
            spirit that turns dreams into delicious reality within the factory's
            towering walls. The signature Wonka Bar combines velvety smooth milk chocolate
            with a secret recipe that took years of eccentric experimentation to perfect -- 
            and yes, absolutely no Oompa Loompas were bothered in the process!
